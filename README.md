Health Connect WDI/UXDI Project

A group project with a UX team providing mockups and wireframes. I worked on creating all of the front-end from the provided mockups. Also setup all page views and routes through express on the back-end/ The app connects children, through their guardians sign up, with doctor-care through the school nurse.
